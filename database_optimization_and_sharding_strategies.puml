  Query Optimization:
  - Use EXPLAIN to analyze query execution plans
  - Optimize complex queries and joins
  - Use appropriate data types

  Indexing Strategy:
  - Create indexes on frequently queried columns
  - Use composite indexes for multi-column queries
  - Regularly analyze and update indexes

  Caching Layer:
  - Implement application-level caching (e.g., Redis)
  - Use database query cache wisely

  Read/Write Separation:
  - Direct reads to replicas
  - Use write-through or write-behind caching
end note

  Range-Based Sharding:
  - Shard by date ranges or alphabetical ranges
  - Good for time-series data or geographically distributed data

  Hash-Based Sharding:
  - Use a hash function to determine shard
  - Ensures even distribution but can complicate range queries

  Directory-Based Sharding:
  - Use a lookup service to map data to shards
  - Flexible but adds complexity and potential bottleneck
end note

note bottom of DataCons
  Eventual Consistency:
  - Faster writes, but reads may be stale
  - Suitable for systems that can tolerate temporary inconsistencies

  Strong Consistency:
  - Ensures all reads reflect the latest write
  - Can impact performance and availability

  Quorum-Based Consistency:
  - Balance between consistency and availability
  - Configurable read/write quorums
end note

  Replication:
  - Implement master-slave or multi-master replication
  - Consider read replicas for scaling read operations

  Failover Mechanism:
  - Implement automatic failover to standby nodes
  - Use health checks to detect node failures

  Load Balancing:
  - Distribute queries across multiple database instances
  - Consider connection pooling for efficient resource use
