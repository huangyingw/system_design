note right of HealthChecker
  Continuously monitors system health
  using various metrics and log analysis
  - CPU, Memory, Disk I/O
  - Network latency and throughput
  - Application-specific health checks
end note

note right of FaultDetector
  Uses ML algorithms to detect anomalies
  and predict potential failures
  - Analyzes historical and real-time data
  - Implements predictive maintenance
end note

note right of ConsistencyManager
  Implements distributed consistency protocols
  - Two-Phase Commit (2PC) for strong consistency
  - Eventual consistency with conflict resolution
  - Quorum-based consistency for read/write operations
end note

note right of RecoveryController
  Automated recovery process:
  1. Detect failure
  2. Activate backup system
  3. Transfer state and traffic
  4. Verify system integrity
  5. Notify administrators
  - Implements circuit breaker pattern
  - Manages graceful degradation
end note

note bottom of LoadBalancer
  Intelligent traffic routing:
  - Health-check based routing
  - Sticky sessions for stateful applications
  - Implements rate limiting and DDoS protection
end note

note bottom of DataReplication
  Ensures data consistency across systems:
  - Synchronous replication for critical data
  - Asynchronous replication for less critical data
  - Implements Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)
  - Manages replication lag and catch-up
end note
