note right of CanaryRelease
  Canary Release:
  - Gradually roll out new version
  - Limit potential impact of issues
  - Easy to rollback if problems occur
end note

note right of BlueGreenDeployment
  Blue-Green Deployment:
  - Two identical production environments
  - Instant cutover between versions
  - Zero downtime deployments
end note

note bottom of Monitoring
  Monitoring & Analytics:
  - Real-time performance tracking
  - Automated alerts for anomalies
  - User experience feedback loop
end note

note bottom of DeploymentPipeline
  Deployment Pipeline:
