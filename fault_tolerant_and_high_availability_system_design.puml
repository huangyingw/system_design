Primary -[#1E88E5,thickness=2]-> HealthChecker : <color:#1E88E5>1. Send health data
HealthChecker -[#FFA000,thickness=2]-> FaultDetector : <color:#FFA000>2. Report anomalies
FaultDetector -[#D81B60,thickness=2]-> RecoveryController : <color:#D81B60>3. Trigger recovery
RecoveryController -[#7CB342,thickness=2]-> Backup : <color:#7CB342>4. Activate backup
RecoveryController -[#5E35B1,thickness=2]-> ConsistencyManager : <color:#5E35B1>5. Ensure data consistency

ConsistencyManager -[#00897B,thickness=2]-> Backup : <color:#00897B>7. Sync data (Backup)

note top of HealthChecker
  Continuously monitors system health
  using various metrics and log analysis
end note

note right of FaultDetector
  Uses ML algorithms to detect anomalies
  and predict potential failures
end note

note right of ConsistencyManager
  Implements eventual consistency
  with conflict resolution strategies
end note

note top of RecoveryController
  Automated recovery process:
  1. Detect failure
  2. Activate backup system
  3. Transfer state and traffic
  4. Verify system integrity
  5. Notify administrators
end note
