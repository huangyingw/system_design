title CDN Security Protection Architecture

actor "User" as user
actor "Attacker" as attacker

rectangle "CDN Security Layer" {
    rectangle "DDoS Protection" as ddos
    rectangle "Web Application Firewall" as waf
    rectangle "Bot Management" as botmgmt
    rectangle "SSL/TLS Encryption" as ssl
    rectangle "Access Control" as access
    rectangle "Rate Limiting" as ratelimit
}

rectangle "Origin Server" as origin

user --> ssl
attacker --> ddos

ddos --> waf : Filtered traffic
waf --> botmgmt : Legitimate requests
botmgmt --> access : Human traffic
access --> ratelimit : Authorized requests
ratelimit --> origin : Controlled traffic flow

note right of ddos : Mitigates volumetric attacks
note right of waf : Blocks malicious requests
note right of botmgmt : Identifies and manages bot traffic
note right of ssl : Ensures data in transit security
note right of access : Implements authentication and authorization
note right of ratelimit : Prevents abuse and ensures fair usage
