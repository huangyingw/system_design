note bottom of SyncServiceCluster
Performance bottlenecks and optimizations:
1. High concurrency during peak hours
   - Implement adaptive scaling
   - Use load shedding techniques
2. Message synchronization delays
   - Optimize database queries
   - Implement efficient caching strategies
end note

note bottom of MessageStore
Optimization suggestions:
1. Implement read replicas for improved read performance
2. Use time-series optimized storage for older messages
3. Implement data partitioning based on message age
end note

note bottom of CachingLayer
Performance enhancements:
1. Implement multi-level caching (L1: in-memory, L2: Redis)
2. Use cache warming for frequently accessed data
3. Implement cache invalidation strategies
end note

note bottom of MessageQueue
Scalability improvements:
1. Implement topic partitioning for better parallelism
2. Use compacted topics for efficient state management
3. Implement dead letter queues for error handling
end note
