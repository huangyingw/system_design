  Sharding:
  - User DB: by user_id
  - Driver DB: by driver_id
  - Trip DB: by trip_id
  - Payment DB: by payment_id
  Redis: Caching, Real-time data
  Kafka: Event streaming

Optimization suggestions:
1. DB read replicas
2. CDN for static assets
3. Query optimization
4. Horizontal scaling
5. Multi-level caching
6. Geospatial query optimization
7. Async processing
8. Circuit breakers
