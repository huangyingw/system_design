note top of SpatialIndex
  Efficiently indexes driver 
  and rider locations
end note

note top of DriverRanking
  Ranks drivers based on 
  proximity, ratings, and 
  other factors
end note

note bottom of RouteOptimizer
  Optimizes routes for 
  multiple pickups and 
  drop-offs (e.g., UberPool)
end note

note bottom of SupplyDemandBalancer
  Adjusts driver supply 
  to meet rider demand 
  across different areas
end note
