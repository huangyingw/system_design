note top of GPSProcessor
  Handles raw GPS data
  from mobile devices
end note

note top of GeocodingService
  Converts GPS coordinates
  to human-readable addresses
end note

note top of GeofencingService
  Manages virtual geographic
  boundaries for specific areas
end note

note bottom of LocationCache
  Redis cluster for
  high-performance caching
  of current locations
end note

note bottom of Flink
  Processes location updates
  in real-time for immediate
  use in the system
end note
