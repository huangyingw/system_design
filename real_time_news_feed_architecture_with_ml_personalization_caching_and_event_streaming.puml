note right of cache
  key: value pairs
  for quick access
end note

note bottom of mq
  Potential bottleneck
  Consider horizontal scaling
  or using a distributed queue system
end note

note right of rec
  CPU intensive
  Consider caching recommendations
  and using machine learning models
end note

note bottom of Server
  Scalability:
  - Use load balancers for API Gateway and services
  - Implement microservices architecture
  - Use containerization (e.g., Docker) for easy scaling
