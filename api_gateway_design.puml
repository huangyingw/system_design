Client -down-> Gateway : 1. API Request
Gateway -down-> Services : 2. Route Request
Gateway -right-> External : 3. Utilize External Services
Services -up-> Gateway : 4. Service Response
Gateway -up-> Client : 5. API Response

note right of Gateway
  Performance bottlenecks:
  1. Authentication: Consider caching tokens
  2. Rate Limiting: Implement distributed rate limiting
  3. Caching: Use in-memory cache for frequently accessed data
end note

note bottom of Services
  Scalability:
  1. Use auto-scaling for microservices
  2. Implement service discovery
  3. Consider using event-driven architecture
end note

note left of External
  External dependencies:
  1. Implement circuit breakers
  2. Use fallback mechanisms
  3. Monitor SLAs of external services
end note
