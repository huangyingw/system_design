' System Description
' Brute-Force Password Cracker: Aiming to recover a lost password for a colleague's Threads account using brute-force attack.
' The process could take several months to years, utilizing both paid computing resources (from private cloud providers like AWS, Azure, GCP)
' and free resources in the form of a temporary public computer network.
' The integration of these two types of resources (Private Cloud Resources and Free Compute Resources) is not clear.

          Advantages of Apache Spark:
          - Efficient large-scale data processing
          - Superior in-memory computing performance
          - Easy to parallelize processing
          - Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDD) for fault tolerance
          - Good adaptability to dynamic workloads
          - Flexible integration capabilities
