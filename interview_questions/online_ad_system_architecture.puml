note right of LoadBalancer
  Optimization: 
  - Distributes traffic
  - Improves availability
end note

note right of CDN
  Optimization:
  - Faster ad content delivery
  - Reduces latency for global users
end note

note right of RTB
  Potential Bottleneck: 
  - High-traffic situations
  Optimization: 
  - Use distributed system
  - Implement caching
  - Optimize algorithms
end note

note bottom of AdMatching
  Potential Bottleneck:
  - Complex matching in real-time
  Optimization:
  - Use high-performance in-memory
    or graph databases
  - Implement ML models
  - Ensure low latency
end note

note left of DataPipeline
  Scalability:
  - Use stream processing
  - Implement data sharding
  - Consider data compression
end note

note top of UserAnalysis
  Potential Bottleneck:
  - Processing large datasets
  Optimization:
  - Use incremental computation
  - Implement approximate algorithms
  - Ensure GDPR compliance
end note

note bottom of CacheLayer
  Optimization:
  - Reduces database load
  - Improves response time
  - Use Redis or Memcached
end note

note left of MessageQueue
  Optimization:
  - Enables asynchronous processing
  - Improves system responsiveness
end note

note bottom of DataStorage
  Potential Bottleneck:
  - Handling increasing data volume
  Optimization:
