Implementation Details:
==
Stream Processing:
- Exactly-once semantics
- Watermark handling
- Checkpointing
- State backends

Storage Strategy:
- Hot/warm/cold tiers
- Data lifecycle
- Compression policies

Performance Features:
- Adaptive batching
- Query optimization
- Cache management

Scalability:
- Horizontal scaling
- Partition management
- Load balancing
