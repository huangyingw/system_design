' Notes
note right of B3 #FFFAFA
  <b>Controller Broker:</b>
  Manages cluster-wide operations
  Performance bottleneck: Consider implementing
  multi-controller for high availability
end note

note bottom of MM #FFFAFA
  Provides insights and facilitates cluster management
  Optimization: Implement automated alerting and
  self-healing mechanisms
end note

note bottom of SL #FFFAFA
  Ensures secure communication and access control
  Consider implementing rotating keys and
  certificate management for enhanced security
