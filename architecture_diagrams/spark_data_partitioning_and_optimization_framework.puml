note right of Partitioning
  Partitioning is how Spark splits data
  into chunks that can be processed in parallel.
  Different methods are available based on data characteristics.
end note

note left of Strategies
  Strategies include how to choose the partitioning method
  and the number of partitions, considering data characteristics
  and processing requirements.
end note

note right of Optimization
  Optimization techniques involve methods
  to improve the efficiency of data processing
  through effective partition management.
end note

note left of Skewness
  Handling data skewness involves techniques
  to evenly distribute data across partitions,
  especially when certain keys are over-represented.
