Alert --> TokenBucket : Collect Metrics
Gateway --> Services : Forward if Allowed

note right of TokenBucket
  Refills tokens at fixed rate
  Best for burst traffic
end note

note right of LeakyBucket
  Processes requests at constant rate
  Smooths out traffic spikes
end note

Implementation Details:
==
Redis Implementation:
- INCR for counters
- EXPIRE for window reset
- Lua scripts for atomic ops

High Availability:
- Redis cluster with replicas
- Circuit breaker pattern
- Fallback to local cache

Performance Optimizations:
- Local caching layer
- Batch counter updates
- Async monitoring
