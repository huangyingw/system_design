Client -down-> Gateway : 1. API Request
Gateway -down-> Services : 2. Route Request
Gateway -right-> External : 3. Utilize External Services
Services -up-> Gateway : 4. Service Response
Gateway -up-> Client : 5. API Response

note top of Gateway
  API Gateway serves as:
  1. Single entry point for all client requests
  2. Request router to appropriate microservices
  3. Protocol translator between clients and services
  4. Security enforcer (authentication, authorization)
  5. Rate limiter to prevent overload
  6. Cache manager for improved performance
  7. Load balancer for even distribution of requests
  8. Monitoring and logging centralization point
end note

note right of Gateway
  Performance bottlenecks:
  1. Authentication: Consider caching tokens
  2. Rate Limiting: Implement distributed rate limiting
  3. Caching: Use in-memory cache for frequently accessed data
end note

note bottom of Services
  Scalability:
  1. Use auto-scaling for microservices
  2. Implement service discovery
  3. Consider using event-driven architecture
end note

note left of External
  External dependencies:
  1. Implement circuit breakers
  2. Use fallback mechanisms
  3. Monitor SLAs of external services
end note
