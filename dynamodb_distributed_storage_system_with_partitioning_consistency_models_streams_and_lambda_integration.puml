note right of TableDesign
  Table Design:
  - Avoid hot partitions
  - Optimize for query patterns
  - Support multiple access patterns
end note

note right of PartitionStrategy
  Partition Strategy:
  - Even data distribution
  - Prevent partition skew
  - Efficient query support
end note

note right of ConsistencyModel
  Consistency Model:
  - Balance performance & consistency
  - Choose per business needs
end note

note bottom of CacheLayer
  Caching Strategy:
  - Optimize read-heavy workloads
  - Reduce DynamoDB load
  - Lower overall latency
end note

note left of LambdaFunctions
  Lambda Use Cases:
  - Real-time processing
  - Data synchronization
  - Event-driven notifications
end note

note bottom of Security
  Security Measures:
  - Fine-grained access control
  - End-to-end encryption
  - Network isolation
end note
