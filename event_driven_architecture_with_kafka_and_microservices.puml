note right of Kafka
  Event Topics:
  - OrderCreated
  - UserRegistered
  - ProductUpdated
  - InventoryChanged
  - NotificationSent
end note

note right of ConsumerServices
  Event Consumers:
  - Process events asynchronously
  - Scale independently
  - Loose coupling with producers
end note

note bottom of Monitoring
  Monitoring & Logging:
  - Centralized logging with ELK
  - Metrics collection with Prometheus
  - Visualization with Grafana
end note
