note right of RecommendationService
  Performance optimization:
  - Use caching to reduce recommendation calculations
  - Optimize recommendation algorithms
  - Increase computational resources for recommendation engines
end note

note right of RRE
  Real-time recommendations based on user behavior,
  improving timeliness and accuracy
end note

note bottom of Database
  Scalability:
  - Implement sharding
  - Use read replicas for heavy read operations
end note

note bottom of DataProcessing
  Continuous improvement:
  - Regular model retraining
  - Feature importance analysis
end note

note right of ExternalServices
  Security:
  - Implement rate limiting
  - Use OAuth 2.0 for authentication
end note

note left of MonitoringLogging
  System health:
  - Set up alerts for anomalies
  - Implement distributed tracing
end note
