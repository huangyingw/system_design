Implementation Details:
==
Session Storage:
- Redis cluster with replication
- Session data encryption at rest
- Automatic session cleanup

High Availability:
- Multiple Redis nodes
- Session service redundancy
- Fallback mechanisms

Security Features:
- Token rotation
- Session hijacking prevention
- Rate limiting

Performance Optimizations:
- Local caching layer
- Session data compression
- Lazy session cleanup
