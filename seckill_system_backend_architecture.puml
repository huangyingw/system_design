  Seckill-specific optimizations:
  - Implement in-memory counters for real-time inventory tracking
  - Use optimistic locking for order creation
  - Employ request merging for batch processing

  CDN for static content,
  Load Balancer for traffic distribution,
  API Gateway for request routing
end note

note right of SecurityLayer
  Implements authentication,
  rate limiting, and DDoS protection
end note

note right of CacheLayer
  Optimize inventory management:
  - Pre-warm inventory data in Redis
  - Use Lua scripts for atomic inventory deduction
  - Implement distributed locks for concurrency control
end note

note bottom of AsyncProcessing
  Enhance async processing:
  - Implement multi-level queues for order processing
  - Use separate queues for different stages (create, pay, notify)
  - Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
end note

note bottom of DataLayer #FFEB3B
  Performance bottleneck:
  - Potential replication lag
  - Uneven data distribution
  Optimization:
  - Implement multi-master replication
  - Optimize sharding strategy
  - Consider NoSQL solutions for specific data
end note

note right of EntryLayer
  Implement aggressive traffic shaping:
  - Token bucket for rate limiting
  - Request queuing and prioritization
  - Dynamic throttling based on system load
end note

note right of GlobalControl
  Implement global traffic control:
  - Dynamic adjustment of traffic based on system health
  - Gradual increase of allowed traffic to prevent sudden spikes
  - Real-time monitoring and automatic intervention
