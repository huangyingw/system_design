note right of EntryLayer
  CDN for static content,
  Load Balancer for traffic distribution,
  API Gateway for request routing
end note

note right of SecurityLayer
  Implements authentication,
  rate limiting, and DDoS protection
end note

note bottom of CacheLayer
  Optimize inventory management:
  - Pre-warm inventory data in Redis
  - Use Lua scripts for atomic inventory deduction
  - Implement distributed locks for concurrency control
  - Multi-level cache: L1 (local), L2 (distributed)
end note

note bottom of AsyncProcessing
  Enhance async processing:
  - Implement multi-level queues for order processing
  - Use separate queues for different stages (create, pay, notify)
  - Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
end note

note bottom of DataLayer
  Performance optimization:
  - Use read replicas for query operations
  - Implement database sharding for write scalability
  - Consider NoSQL solutions for specific data types:
    1. Redis (Key-Value Store):
       - Real-time inventory counts
       - Session data and user tokens
    2. MongoDB (Document Store):
       - Product catalogs with flexible schemas
       - User profiles and preferences
    3. Cassandra (Wide-column Store):
       - Time-series data for analytics
       - High-volume write operations (e.g., click streams)
    4. Neo4j (Graph Database):
       - Social connections and recommendations
    5. Elasticsearch (Search Engine):
       - Full-text search for products and content
end note
