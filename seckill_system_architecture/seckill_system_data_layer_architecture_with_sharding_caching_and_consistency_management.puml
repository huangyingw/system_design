note right of DataAccessLayer
  Handles data access operations,
  connection pooling, and query optimization
end note

note right of DatabaseSharding
  Distributes data across multiple
  database instances for scalability
end note

note right of Cache
  Improves read performance
  by caching frequently accessed data
end note

note right of PersistentStorage
  Ensures data durability with
  master-slave replication
end note

note right of DataConsistency
  Manages data consistency across
  distributed database instances
end note

note right of BackupRecovery
  Implements regular backups and
  point-in-time recovery mechanisms
end note
